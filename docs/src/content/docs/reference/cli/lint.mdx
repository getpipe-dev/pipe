title: pipe lint
description: Lint a pipeline for errors and warnings.
---

## Synopsis

```
pipe lint <name>
```

## Description

Resolves the pipeline (alias, Hub, or local), parses the YAML, checks for errors, and reports warnings. Does not execute any steps.

**Errors** (pipeline is invalid):
- Invalid or unknown YAML fields (strict parsing)
- Missing required fields (`id`, `run` on each step)
- Invalid variable keys
- Dependency cycles and self-dependencies

**Warnings** (pipeline is valid but may have issues):
- Unknown `depends_on` references (ignored at runtime)
- Possible embedded secrets in non-sensitive steps
- Unused declared variables
- `cache` combined with `sensitive`
- References to sensitive step output variables
- Missing pipeline description (lint-only)
- `retry > 0` combined with `sensitive: true` (lint-only)

> **Backward compatibility:** `pipe validate` is accepted as an alias.

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `<name>` | Pipeline name, alias, or `owner/name` path |

## Flags

None.

## Examples

```bash
pipe lint deploy
```

```
pipeline "deploy" is valid
```

With warnings:

```bash
pipe lint my-pipeline
```

```
WARN step "fetch": unknown dependency "setup" (ignored)
WARN step "auth": possible secret detected (GitHub token) — consider adding sensitive: true
pipeline "my-pipeline" is valid with 2 warning(s)
```
